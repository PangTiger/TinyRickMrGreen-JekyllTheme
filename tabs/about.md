# LAU Ka Kei(LIU Jiaqi)

Greetings! I am LAU Ka Kei(LIU Jiaqi), affectionately known as Rick. Currently, I am immersed in the complexities of my Ph.D. studies in electronic and computer engineering at HKUST. With a robust academic background from Sun Yat-sen University, where I specialized in Microelectronics Science and Engineering, I graduated with a distinguished GPA of 3.9/4.0.

# FreeCircuit
Currently, I am the Founder of FreeCircuit Team:)

We are actively looking for cooperations including Funding/Tech/Business/Connections!
