As an aspiring innovator in the field of electronic and computer engineering, I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at HKUST. My academic rigor was honed during my Bachelor's studies at Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on Microelectronics Science and Engineering, where I graduated with an impressive GPA of 3.9/4.0.

My technical interests span from theoretical underpinnings to practical applications, particularly in programming and the design of analog integrated circuits. I am committed to contributing to advances in deep neural network capabilities, as evidenced by my work on the PHANES project - a ReRAM-based photonic accelerator presented to the Association for Computing Machinery.

My dedication to excellence has been recognized through several prestigious awards:

Huawei Excellent Student Scholarship - An honor bestowed by Huawei Company and Sun Yat-sen University for exceptional academic performance in November 2019.

First Prize in the Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling - Awarded by the Organizing Committee of the Guangdong Province Division of the National College Students Mathematical Contest in Modeling in October 2019.

Third Prize in the National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest - Presented by the Organizing Committee of the Guangdong Province Division of the National Undergraduate Electronic Design Competition in September 2019.

The First Prize Excellent Student Scholarship - Conferred by the School of Electronics and Information Technology, SYSU, in recognition of academic distinction in September 2018.
