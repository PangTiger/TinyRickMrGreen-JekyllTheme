# Welcome to Liu Jiaqi's (Rick) FreeCircuit(弗思科技） Team!

## About Me
As a third-year Ph.D. candidate at HKUST, my research is at the intersection of AI chip design and computational architectures, with a focus on innovative applications in electronic and computer engineering.

## Collaboration
I am always open to collaborative opportunities that push the boundaries of technology and contribute to our understanding and capabilities in this field. 

My investigative pursuits are twofold:
- Encompassing AI chip design assisted by large language models(LLM)
- Architectures and compilers for accelerating large language models(LLM)
