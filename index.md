# Welcome to FreeCircuit(弗思科技) Team!

## About Me
As a third-year Ph.D. candidate at HKUST, my research is at the intersection of AI chip design and computational architectures, with a focus on innovative applications in electronic and computer engineering.

## About FreeCircuit
Here is our introduction slide and video link:

Check out the [Fusi]'s video!

[Fusi]: https://hkust.zoom.us/rec/share/0KVFRvqdZstKXlmTAusX-74GwzSAMY2JRnxpkm9qAydLq5ie-nnYw7e2mqk98sm0.z-dMhzC-s5EvWhbK?startTime=1701070453000


Our goal is to build up an automatic slicon-based intelligence.

The first step is to develop a Bus and Train Real-time Identification System with our own-designed chips.

The future steps is to democratize the AGI chips and make it available for everyone in the WORLD!

We don't need OpenAI, but we indeed need FreeCricuit!:)

## Collaboration
I am always open to collaborative opportunities that push the boundaries of technology and contribute to our understanding and capabilities in this field. 

My investigative pursuits are twofold:
- Encompassing AI chip design assisted by large language models(LLM)
- Architectures and compilers for accelerating large language models(LLM)
