This is a random thought.

A bigwig at Alibaba said,
"Every industry deserves to be redone with large models."
I would like to extend this to become,
"Every problem deserves to be redone with large models."

Because as long as it is a task that humans can perform,
whether it is in mathematics, physics, engineering research,
or in painting, music, art,
it is possible to use artificial intelligence to try to imitate or replace humans at work.
This is not just AI for Science but AI for X,
where X stands for everything.

For example, in our field, it means using AI to design chips,
and then designing chips to accelerate AI operation.
This is a bi-directional rush in a closed-loop circuit.
We know this is positive feedback,
which will continue to amplify and oscillate,
eventually leading to a new technological revolution.

At Northwestern University in the United States, there is a project called CS+X,
the essential idea is that AI or LLM large models
can penetrate various industries
and gradually affect and change the entire human world.

LLM large models have already made some progress in the field of chip design.
If future LLMs can design chips themselves,
designing chips that run LLM AI,
it means they are capable of self-replication and regeneration,
which then have the potential for optimization and even evolution,
beginning to approach carbon-based life infinitely.
A new era may really be coming.

I do not know if the 21st century is the century of biology,
but I do know that the 21st century will definitely be the century of a massive explosion of silicon-based life.
This may be the most spectacular industrial revolution in human history,
and it may also be the end of the history of carbon-based life's dominance.
